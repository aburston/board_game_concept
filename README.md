# board_game_concept
Board game idea based on building and programming your own units

 * Create your own units based on simple rules
 * Program each unit to pay the game
 * Run the game automatically resolving the winner
 * Win condition = last player with a functional unit
 
# server idea

 * The server should be running permanently, and automatically commit whenever all the players commit
 * The players should be paused after their commit and wait for the server to commit
